This inclides the files and code documents to complete the British Airways Internship
## Project 1 
The task was to scrap the web for reviews on British Airways. Then conduct a sentiment analysis on the reviews to see how the customers viewed the experience. The results showed that overall the customers had a positive outlook on their exoerience. 
## Project 2
The Task was to use data collected from bookings to see if it is possible to predict the booking of a holiday on British AIrways website. When looking at the data a majority of the bookings were not purchased which made the model struggle at predicting the target. In the end the models were not able to succesffuly seperate the two classes and more features would be needed to provide better insights.
